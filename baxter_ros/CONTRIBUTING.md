## Style 

We follow the [C++ ROS style guidelines](http://ros.org/wiki/CppStyleGuide) and 
conventions as closely as possible. However, because the plugins inherit from Gazebo 
classes and Gazebo follows a very different formatting standard, there are a few 
exceptions where Gazebo's function names do not comply to the ROS guidelines.
